      <description>Coming from a VB.Net, Java, C# and Python background, when I first started using Go I was very annoyed by the lack of some patterns on a language level. It took me a while using the language to find out those patterns can be easily expressed.
Here is a collection of some common patterns and the best way I&amp;rsquo;ve found to express them.
Decorators This feature is extensively used in most object oriented languages, and consists in somehow taking a function or method and enrich it with other effects or properties.</description>

      <description>The story Sometimes you have to solve a problem that comes in several flavours. Usually complicated problems do not offer a single solution, but there are several solutions that are optimal or terrible depending on which subset of that problem the program will have to solve at runtime.
One example I faced was to analyse some data flowing in some connections that I was proxying.
There are two main ways to extract some information from traffic: you can either record the entire traffic to analyse it as soon as it is done, or you can analyse it while it flows(with a buffer window) at the cost of slowing it down.</description>
