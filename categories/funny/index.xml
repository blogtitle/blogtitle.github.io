      <description>After 5 years of using Go I am finally moving on. Go has served me well and has been the best language I could have possibly used for the longest time, but it is now the moment for me to let it Go.
Over time Go has not failed to show me its limitations and its issues, to the point where I decided to switch to something more future proof and with a more thriving community.</description>

      <description>Preface I love using regular expressions. They are such a powerful tool, they are complex, concise, complex, expressive, complex, broadly supported, complex and easy to write.
They are the perfect tool if you want to write a simple script and you need to elaborate text. Some downsides are that they are complex, surprising, and very inefficient compared with simpler string manipulations primitives (e.g contains, hasPrefix, trim, replace,&amp;hellip;)
Regular The &amp;ldquo;reg&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;regexp&amp;rdquo; stands for regular.</description>

      <description>Short preface: The first version of JavaScript was completed in ten days in order to accommodate the Netscape Navigator 2.0 Beta release schedule.
Keep in mind that well structured languages usually take a little bit more than that.
What follows is a small piece of the aftermath of the rushed job.
NOTE: There is more madness in destroy all software&amp;rsquo;s wat video, which I suggest watching before reading this post.</description>
