      <description>Disclaimer: this is not an official Google post or communication, it is just me commenting on something that is now available.
 The Google infosec team just released the Go &amp;ldquo;safehtml&amp;rdquo; package. If you are interested in making your application resilient to server-side XSS you might want to adopt it instead of &amp;ldquo;html/template&amp;rdquo;. Migration to safehtml should be quite straightforward as it is just a hardened fork of the original html/template standard package.</description>

      <description>Coming from a VB.Net, Java, C# and Python background, when I first started using Go I was very annoyed by the lack of some patterns on a language level. It took me a while using the language to find out those patterns can be easily expressed.
Here is a collection of some common patterns and the best way I&amp;rsquo;ve found to express them.
Decorators This feature is extensively used in most object oriented languages, and consists in somehow taking a function or method and enrich it with other effects or properties.</description>

      <description>The impact The first language I used to build something more than just school exercises was VisualBasic.Net. There are some good things and bad things in it, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to discuss that today. I switched to C# after that and Java and Python after it.
This is to say that basically up until three years ago I knew one and only one way to handle errors which is expressed in the following pseudocode:</description>

      <description>The problem Some days ago I was looking at some configuration files that were presented in this form:
# # This is a section # VALUE_ENABLED=y # VALUE_DISABLED  The problem in reading this stuff is that both comments and non-comments are relevant and none should be ignored since a disabled feature could cause as much trouble as an enabled one.
I would have liked to see comments in a different file than the rest, so I thought: &amp;ldquo;Well, this is an easy job for grep&amp;rdquo;.</description>
