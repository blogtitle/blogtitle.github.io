      <description>The problem Some days ago I was looking at some configuration files that were presented in this form:
# # This is a section # VALUE_ENABLED=y # VALUE_DISABLED  The problem in reading this stuff is that both comments and non-comments are relevant and none should be ignored since a disabled feature could cause as much trouble as an enabled one.
I would have liked to see comments in a different file than the rest, so I thought: &amp;ldquo;Well, this is an easy job for grep&amp;rdquo;.</description>
