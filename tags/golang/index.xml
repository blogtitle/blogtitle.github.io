      <title>Go Advanced concurrency patterns: part 2 (timers)</title>

      <description>As I stated in my previous article timers are hard to use the right way so here are some handful tips.
Preface If you don&amp;rsquo;t think dealing with time and timers while also juggling goroutines is hard, here are some juicy bugs related to time.Timer:
 time: Timer.Reset is not possible to use correctly #14038 time: Timer.C can still trigger even after Timer.Reset is called #11513 time: document proper usage of Timer.</description>

      <description>Writing code is hard. Writing code that has to deal with parallelism and concurrency is harder. Doing all of that an keeping it efficient is challenging.
Today I decided to start sharing a couple of tricks to handle some peculiar cases.
Timed channels operations Sometimes you want to time your channels operations: keep trying to do something, and if you can&amp;rsquo;t do it in time just drop the ball.</description>

      <description>Preface One of the features that I love the most about Go is the fact that it is unsurprising. One could even say that it is boring in some sense. This is a good trait of a programming language. When you code you should focus on the problem at hand, and not on what your language is doing that you don&amp;rsquo;t want.
This article talks about one of the most &amp;ldquo;surprising&amp;rdquo; features of Go for newcomers: slices.</description>

      <description>Coming from a VB.Net, Java, C# and Python background, when I first started using Go I was very annoyed by the lack of some patterns on a language level. It took me a while using the language to find out those patterns can be easily expressed.
Here is a collection of some common patterns and the best way I&amp;rsquo;ve found to express them.
Decorators This feature is extensively used in most object oriented languages, and consists in somehow taking a function or method and enrich it with other effects or properties.</description>

      <description>The story Sometimes you have to solve a problem that comes in several flavours. Usually complicated problems do not offer a single solution, but there are several solutions that are optimal or terrible depending on which subset of that problem the program will have to solve at runtime.
One example I faced was to analyse some data flowing in some connections that I was proxying.
There are two main ways to extract some information from traffic: you can either record the entire traffic to analyse it as soon as it is done, or you can analyse it while it flows(with a buffer window) at the cost of slowing it down.</description>

      <title>Considerations on error handling</title>

      <description>The impact The first language I used to build something more than just school exercises was VisualBasic.Net. There are some good things and bad things in it, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to discuss that today. I switched to C# after that and Java and Python after it.
This is to say that basically up until three years ago I knew one and only one way to handle errors which is expressed in the following pseudocode:</description>

      <title>Unmarshaling JSON in Golang</title>
      <link>https://blogtitle.github.io/unmarshaling-json-in-golang/</link>

      <description>Unmarshaling JSON files in Golang can be tricky. Golang is a statically typed language and does not allow dynamic JSON deserialization. In order to unmarshal a JSON blob into Golang it usually requires to know its structure beforehand. But, as the internal documentation states, it is possible to unmarshal JSON into an empty interface.
An empty interface represents the empty set of methods and is satisfied by any value, since any value has zero or more methods.</description>
