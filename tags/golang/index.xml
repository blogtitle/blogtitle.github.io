      <description>Coming from a VB.Net, Java, C# and Python background, when I first started using Go I was very annoyed by the lack of some patterns on a language level. It took me a while using the language to find out those patterns can be easily expressed.
Here is a collection of some common patterns and the best way I&amp;rsquo;ve found to express them.
Decorators This feature is extensively used in most object oriented languages, and consists in somehow taking a function or method and enrich it with other effects or properties.</description>

      <description>The impact The first language I used to build something more than just school exercises was VisualBasic.Net. There are some good things and bad things in it, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to discuss that today. I switched to C# after that and Java and Python after it.
This is to say that basically up until three years ago I knew one and only one way to handle errors which is expressed in the following pseudocode:</description>

      <title>Unmarshaling JSON in Golang</title>

      <description>Unmarshaling JSON files in Golang can be tricky. Golang is a statically typed language and does not allow dynamic JSON deserialization. In order to unmarshal a JSON blob into Golang it usually requires to know its structure beforehand. But, as the internal documentation states, it is possible to unmarshal JSON into an empty interface.
An empty interface represents the empty set of methods and is satisfied by any value, since any value has zero or more methods.</description>
