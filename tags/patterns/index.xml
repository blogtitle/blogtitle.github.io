      <title>Sneaky race conditions and granular locks</title>

      <description>Race conditions are the main problem you have to care about when writing concurrent code. Go provides high level primitives that make it easier to get concurrency and parallelism right, but those are often times not enough.
This is one of the reasons why Go has a race detector. You should always run your tests and, where possible, a portion of your production fleet with -race enabled. Beware that this might still not be enough: the detector only triggers when a race manifests and not all races are detected by it.</description>

      <description>Edit (16 Dec 2024) This post is still here for historical reasons, but it&amp;rsquo;s now quite old.
The sync package has evolved since then and some primitives have become available.
While all the channel and select semantics have stayed the same, please consider this as a post on how to better understand channels semantics rather than documentation or replacement for the sync package.
Previous Post Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to dive into the expressive power of Go channels and the select statement.</description>

      <title>Using JavaScript SharedArrayBuffers and Atomics</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of JavaScript but I like parallel programming and JS has some interesting concepts of it.
In addition to the event loop I&amp;rsquo;ve recently got to know the concept of Web Workers. They are real threads that execute in parallel with the main thread, and are allowed to wait and block as much as they want.
Modern devices are going in the direction of having a lot of FPS and web developers want to maintain the user experience smooth.</description>

      <description>As I stated in my previous article timers are hard to use the right way so here are some handful tips.
Edit (16 Dec 2024) This post is still here for historical reasons, but it&amp;rsquo;s now quite old.
Many of the issues in this post have been corrected and some footguns don&amp;rsquo;t hold true anymore.
Please consider this as a window into a &amp;ldquo;previous Go experience&amp;rdquo; and nothing more.</description>

      <description>Writing code is hard. Writing code that has to deal with parallelism and concurrency is harder. Doing all of that an keeping it efficient is challenging.
Today I decided to start sharing a couple of tricks to handle some peculiar cases.
Timed channels operations Sometimes you want to time your channels operations: keep trying to do something, and if you can&amp;rsquo;t do it in time just drop the ball.</description>
