      <description>I want to tell you a story somebody shared with me. Nobody knows where the story comes from, or who invented it, but now it&amp;rsquo;s widely used as an exercise to improve communication skills. I changed the names of the characters in order to be gender neutral, so, please, bear with me as some sentences are bulky.
Once upon a time, a long long time ago, there was a town. The town was cut in two halves by a large river.</description>

      <title>Unmarshaling JSON in Golang</title>

      <description>Unmarshaling JSON files in Golang can be tricky. Golang is a statically typed language and does not allow dynamic JSON deserialization. In order to unmarshal a JSON blob into Golang it usually requires to know its structure beforehand. But, as the internal documentation states, it is possible to unmarshal JSON into an empty interface.
An empty interface represents the empty set of methods and is satisfied by any value, since any value has zero or more methods.</description>

      <description>This last weekend I flew to Hawaii for the first time in my life. What. An. Experience. Before leaving I read a couple of travel guides online, but nothing prepared me for the beauty of this island.
The flight I chose was on a Friday night. By 0330 I was done with my work for the week; quickly grabbed enough clothes for 4 days, my travel backpack and I was on a Lyft to the airport.</description>
